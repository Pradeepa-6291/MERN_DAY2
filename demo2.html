    <p class="one"> <b><u> <h3>Chapter 1 The Whispering Woods</u></b></h3>
    
       <br> Arun had always heard rumors about the Whispering Woods, but he never believed them until the day he stepped inside. The trees seemed alive, their branches swaying without wind, murmuring secrets he couldn’t quite understand. As he walked deeper, he felt a strange pull, as though something—or someone—was guiding him toward a hidden truth buried beneath the forest floor.

    <p class="second"> <h3><b><u>Chapter 2 – The Forgotten Key</u></b></h3><br>At the heart of the woods, Arun stumbled upon an old stone pedestal covered in moss. On top of it lay a rusted key glowing faintly with a soft blue light. The moment his fingers touched it, visions flashed before him—ancient guardians, lost civilizations, and a door sealed for centuries. Breathless, he realized the key was meant for him, chosen long before he was even born. </p>
